# Speech_emotion_recognition
Speech Emotion Recognition (SER), is the act of attempting to recognize human emotion and affective states from speech.In this Python based project, we have used the libraries librosa, soundfile, and sklearn (among others) to build a model using an MLPClassifier. This will be able to recognize emotion from sound files. We have loaded the data, extracted the audio features (mfcc, Stft,Melspectogram) from it, then split the dataset into training and testing sets. Then, we’ll initialize an MLPClassifier and train the model. Finally, we’ll calculate the accuracy of our model.
